Installation guide for mac:
- Copy the bin folder in this directory to your preferred folder 
  (/Applications/openda/bin is recommended) of add the jar file model_RRMDA_Themi 
  to your pre-existing openDA distribution. model_RRMDA_Themi has been compiled 
  with release 2.2 of openDA. 
- Open ~/.profile (not ~./bashrc as stated in the openDA installation guides. 
  ~/.bashrc is not read automatically upon login). Add the following lines:
      $ export OPENDADIR=<bindir>
      $ . $OPENDADIR/setup_openda.sh 
  <bindir> is the path to the bin openDA-bin directory where you stored the jar
  files. For example /Application/openDA_2.2/bin/.
